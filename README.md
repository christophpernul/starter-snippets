# starter-snippets
Notebooks or pieces of code, that aim to provide an introduction to different programming languages.

# Structure
## Julia notebooks
### julia_starter_notebook.ipynb
Shows many of the basic datatypes and commands in the Julia language.

## Python Dash
### Responsive column explanation
python_dash_responsive_columns.py
An example dashboard with multiple rows and columns and different alignments.

### Multi-Page App with Callbacks
#### python_dash_callbacks_app.py: Defines the app
#### python_dash_callbacks_index.py: Loads the app and defines the layout for the whole dashboard.
#### python_dash_callbacks_subapp.py: Defines one of several subapps, that uses a callback for a dropdown element.

This is a minimal example of the structure an app needs to have in order to use callbacks in multiple python files without having problems with cyclical imports leading to callbacks not being executed.
